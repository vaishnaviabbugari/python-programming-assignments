# ### 1.Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
# 
Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.
Example: Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:100,150,180
The output of the program should be: 18,22,24
# In[3]:



from math import sqrt
def calculateProgram():
    in_num = eval(input("Enter the Input: "))
    out_num = []
    C = 50 # Declaring and initializing constant C
    H = 30 # Declaring and initializing constant H
    for ele in in_num:
        Q = str(int(sqrt((2*C*ele)/H)))
        out_num.append(Q)
    print("Output: {}".format(','.join(out_num)))
    
calculateProgram()


# ### 2.Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j. 
# 
# Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡Y-1.
Example: Suppose the following inputs are given to the program: 3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]
# In[3]:



import array as arr
def generateArray():
    in_x = int(input('Enter the No of Rows:'))
    in_y = int(input('Enter the No of Columns:')) 
    out_array = []
    for ele in range(in_x):
        out_array.insert(in_x,[])
        for sub_ele in range(in_y):
            out_array[ele].append(ele*sub_ele)
    print(out_array)
    
generateArray()


# ### 3.Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically ?
# 

# In[4]:



def sortString():
    in_string = input("Enter the Input String: ")
    out_string = ','.join(sorted(in_string.split(',')))
    print(f'Output: {out_string}')
    
sortString()


# ### 4.Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
# Then, the output should be: again and hello makes perfect practice world
# 

# In[6]:


def sortAlphaNumerically():
    in_string = input("Enter the Input String: ")
    out_string = ' '.join(sorted(sorted(list(set(in_string.split(" "))))))
    print(f'Output: {out_string}')
    
sortAlphaNumerically()


# ### 5.Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: hello world! 123
# Then, the output should be:
# LETTERS 10
# DIGITS 3
# 

# In[7]:



def countLetterAndDigits():
    in_string = input("Enter the Input String: ")
    lettersList = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    digitsList = '0123456789'
    letters = 0
    digits = 0
    for ele in in_string:
        if ele in lettersList:
            letters += 1
        if ele in digitsList:
            digits += 1
    print(f'LETTERS {letters} \nDIGITS {digits}')
        
countLetterAndDigits()


# ### 6.A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
# Following are the criteria for checking the password:
# 
# 
# At least 1 letter between [a-z]
# At least 1 number between [0-9]
# At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
# At least 1 character from [$#@]
# Minimum length of transaction password: 6
# Maximum length of transaction password: 12
# Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
# 
# Example:
# If the following passwords are given as input to the program: ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
# Then, the output of the program should be:ABd1234@1
# 
# 

# In[8]:



def checkPassword():
    in_string = input("Enter the Input String: ")
    small_list = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    cap_list = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    num_list = "0123456789"
    special_list = "$#@"
    for ele in in_string.split(","):
        if len(ele) <= 12 and len(ele) >=6 :
            if any(i.isupper() for i in ele):
                if any(i.islower() for i in ele):
                    if any(i for i in ele if i in special_list):
